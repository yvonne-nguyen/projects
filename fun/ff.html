<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>The Center for Disease Control recommends that anyone over the age of 6 months should get an annual flu vaccine  as a preventative measure against the flu season. When an individual wants to schedule a vaccination appointment, they typically call their doctor's office or go to a pharmacy. Given this, it could be difficult for one to choose which vaccination site is best suited for one's unique needs (e.g., requiring a particular vaccine). Due to how frequently one should get this vaccine, there should be an efficient way for one to (1) find and (2) schedule a vaccination appointment.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>[F]lu [F]inder allows users to schedule the vaccine(s) of their choice through comparing multiple chain pharmacies in order to find out which pharmacy best suits their needs.</p>

<h1>User Research</h1>
<p>I observed my interviewee schedule their flu vaccine on CVS.com and asked them contextual inquiry questions afterwards. These are my key takeaways from the interview:
    <ol>
        <li>Location Matters</li>
        <p>My interviewee prefers that the vaccination site is both (1) nearby and (2) easy to drive to. Although their university offers free flu vaccinations, because the majority of their classes are online, and since their school is located in Downtown San Jose (my participant feels uneasy driving in that area), they are not getting their flu vaccine there.
        </p>
        <li>Convenience</li>
        <p>My participant prefers scheduling their flu appointment digitally because they have the option to see which dates and times are available.</p>
        <li>Insurance and Primary Physician's Information</li>
        <p>My participant did not have their insurance and primary physician's information on-hand. Hence, the application took longer than they expected. Additionally, the application had unclear instructions and they were unsure if certain information was mandatory or not.</p>
      </ol>

<h1>Wireframes and Wireflows </h1>
<p>These wireframe sketches support two features: (1) notice of required materials and a (2) sort and filter option. I included a notice prior to the start of the application process in order to inform users of the materials they would need. This would expedite the application process. The sort and filter option allows users to filter pharmacies within a given X mile radius and sort them by distance.</p>

<h1>Prototype Testing </h1>
<p>Before I designed low-fidelity wireframes on Figma, I did some prototype testing to determine which aspects of this design I could improve. I assigned the user five tasks:
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Schedule a vaccination appointment.</li>
        <li>Find out the information  needed to complete the scheduling application.</li>
        <li>Filter results by distance (1 mile) and time/date (Oct 2, 2021 at 3PM).</li>
        <li>Sort by distance (closest to furthest).</li>
        <li>Edit a typo found on the "summary" page.</li>
      </ol>
<p>After the prototype testing, I decided to include additional features into my design:</p>
<ol>
    <li>A “progress bar” that indicates the user’s progress in the application process. This progress bar will be on the personal information, insurance information, primary physician’s contact information, contact information, and summary screens. Each page will represent a “dot/circle” and the user can click on each “dot/circle” to move around.</li>
    <li>A Search bar for the vaccine selection page. My user noted that I only offered a small selection of vaccines, and proposed an option where there were 20+ vaccine options to choose from. In this situation, it would be best to have a search so the user can quickly find what they are looking for (instead of sifting through every choice).</li>
    <li>Have filter options for the vaccine location on the address page because it is confusing as to what the default distance setting is. When the user used the filter option, he noted how he was confused as to why he had to change it to 1 mile because he wasn't sure what the default distance "filter" was.</li>
  </ol>
<h1>High-fidelity Prototype</h1>
<p>My high fidelity prototype has three features: notice of required materials, sort and filter option, and light/dark mode toggle.</p>
